    | Closing without deciding brings the banner back; nothing is stored and no
    | service unlocks. Under the GDPR no decision is not consent, so a setting
    | that let a site treat it as one would be a setting for breaking the law.
    | (Until 1.6.0 a `reject_on_dismiss` key sat here and did nothing at all —
    | the behaviour was always the strict one.)
    |
    | "respect_gpc" honours the Global Privacy Control browser signal, which
    | German courts have read as a valid objection.

    | Proof of consent

    | visitor's own browser is not proof: it belongs to them and they can change
    | it. Switch this on to keep a server-side record.
    |
    | Off by default, for three reasons. A site with no optional services has
    | nothing to prove. A record is itself a processing activity and belongs in
    | your privacy policy. And it needs a database, which a flat installation
    | may not have.
    |
    | What is stored: the random id from the cookie, a timestamp, the version
    | consented to, the granted handles, how the decision was made, and the site.
    | Deliberately NOT stored: IP address and user agent. Both are personal data
    | in their own right and neither is needed — the id does the linking. Storing
    | them turns a proof log into a visitor database.
    |
    | Run `php artisan migrate` after switching this on.
