# Changelog

## 1.5.0

### What's changed

- **The banner no longer arrives wearing someone else's brand.** The stylesheet's defaults were,
  literally, one particular website's identity: a warm yellow (`#E8B931`), a cream ground
  (`#FAF8F4`), a 40px corner radius, pill-shaped buttons and tiny wide-spaced capitals. Every site
  that installed this addon got that look on its own pages until it overrode it. The defaults are
  now neutral — near-black on near-white, a 16px radius, ordinary sentence-case buttons — so an
  un-themed banner reads as *plain*, not as *foreign*.

  This is a **visual breaking change** for anyone who relied on the old look. Restore it by setting
  the tokens yourself; the README's "Making it yours" section starts with exactly this.

### What's new

- **The shape and the label style are tokens now**, not hard-coded values. Previously only colour
  and type family were yours; the round buttons and the spaced capitals were the addon's opinion and
  could only be undone with `!important`. New custom properties:
  `--csnt-radius-button`, `--csnt-radius-pill`, `--csnt-btn-size`, `--csnt-btn-weight`,
  `--csnt-btn-tracking`, `--csnt-btn-transform`, `--csnt-label-tracking`, `--csnt-label-transform`,
  `--csnt-title-weight`, `--csnt-title-tracking`, `--csnt-shadow-knob`.

- **Your tokens now survive dark mode.** The three token blocks moved into a `@layer`, and unlayered
  CSS beats every layer regardless of specificity. Before this, `:root[data-consent-theme="dark"]`
  (0,1,1) outranked a host's plain `:root` (0,1,0), so a site that had themed the banner watched its
  brand disappear the moment dark mode was switched on — visible in light, gone in dark. The
  component rules are deliberately **not** layered; those are the widget's mechanics.

### What's fixed

- **The secondary button became unreadable on hover.** `.csnt-btn--secondary:hover` set its
  background to `--csnt-brand` while leaving the label at `--csnt-ink`. In the new neutral defaults
  those two are the same value, so the label vanished into the button. It now lifts to
  `--csnt-surface-muted-line`, which is what the equivalent rule in the panel footer already did.

- **A hard-coded `border-radius: 2rem` under 30rem** overrode `--csnt-radius-card` on phones, so a
  site with square corners still got the old rounded card on mobile and could not fix it with a
  token. Removed.

- **`--csnt-radius-inner` was documented and defined but never used.** It now styles the blocked-embed
  placeholder, which is what its name promised.

- **The switch knob's shadow was the only hard-coded colour left**, and it was the old warm palette's
  (`rgba(20, 18, 16, …)`). It is `--csnt-shadow-knob` now, with a value per theme.

- Three defaults were quoted wrongly in the README. A new test compares every documented token
  against the stylesheet, so the table cannot drift again.

## 1.4.1

### What's fixed

- **The proof-of-consent endpoint answered 419 on every real delivery.** The route excluded
  `VerifyCsrfToken`, but Laravel 12 and 13 register `PreventRequestForgery` in the `web` group and
  `VerifyCsrfToken` is its *subclass* — and `Router::resolveMiddleware()` removes only what is a
  subclass of the excluded class, never the parent. So the check stayed on, the browser's `fetch`
  carries no token, and nothing was ever recorded. Invisible to the suite because
  `PreventRequestForgery::handle()` returns early under `runningUnitTests()`; the new test therefore
  asserts the route's gathered middleware list rather than making a request. **Anyone running 1.4.0
  with `record.enabled` has an empty log and should update.**

## 1.4.0

### What's new

- **Proof of consent**, off by default. Article 7(1) GDPR puts the burden of proof on the controller,
  and a value in the visitor's own browser is not proof. Switch on `record.enabled`, run
  `php artisan migrate`, and every decision is recorded server-side — the id, timestamp, version,
  granted handles and how it was decided. **No IP address, no user agent**: both are personal data in
  their own right and neither is needed.
- **`php please consent:lookup`** answers the question the log exists for, with `--latest` and
  `--csv`. **`php please consent:prune`** enforces the retention.

## 1.3.1

### What's fixed

- **`{{ consent:granted }}` never worked.** The cookie is written by JavaScript and is therefore not
  encrypted; Laravel's `EncryptCookies` middleware discarded it, so the server saw no cookie at all.
  The failure looked exactly like "nobody has consented yet", which is why it survived a green
  suite, a playground and a production install. The cookie is now registered with
  `EncryptCookies::except()`, and the exemption follows a renamed cookie.

## 1.3.0

Both of these came out of the first real installation, on a site that loads no third party at all.

### What's new

- **No services ship.** A service listed by default appears in the banner of every fresh install,
  describing data processing that site may not do. Add the ones your site actually loads; the config
  file carries the three most common as commented examples.

### What's fixed

- **A list emptied in the control panel stayed empty no longer than a page load.** Deleting every
  service fell back to the shipped list, so a client who removed them got them back — along with a
  banner asking about services their site does not load. An emptied list is an answer, not a missing
  value.

## 1.2.1

### What's fixed

- `php please consent:install` died with "mkdir(): Permission denied" on a containerised Statamic,
  where the application directory belongs to root while the process runs as www-data. Publishing the
  blueprint is a convenience; the global set is the job. It now warns, says where to copy the file
  from, and carries on.
- The install command had no test at all. It has three now, including the unwritable case.

## 1.2.0

### What's new

- **Nothing to ask, nothing rendered.** With no optional service configured, `{{ consent:head }}`,
  `{{ consent:banner }}` and `{{ consent:settings_link }}` render nothing at all. Strictly necessary
  cookies need no consent, so a site that loads no third party has nothing to put in a banner — and
  that is the state every installation is in on its first day. A gate still blocks.

## 1.1.0

### What's new

- **Google Consent Mode v2**, off by default. Map each of Google's four signals to the services
  behind it; the `consent default` call is written inline and first, the update follows the
  visitor's decision.
- **Browser tests** for the three behaviours the PHP suite cannot reach: the localStorage mirror,
  Global Privacy Control and parked scripts. `npm test`.

### What's fixed

- Closing the settings panel with **Escape** without deciding left the visitor with no banner and no
  decision. Every way out now behaves the same.
- The CI matrix tested a Laravel 11 leg that Statamic 6 can never satisfy, and `orchestra/testbench`
  was pinned to Laravel 12 only, so the Laravel 13 leg could not resolve either.

## 1.0.0

### What's new

- **The banner is a card in the bottom-left corner and the settings panel sits in the opposite
  corner**, in the shape adriangoldner.com established — not a bar across the page. No font is
  loaded: the banner inherits the site's own faces. Every colour, radius and shadow is a custom
  property.

- **Cookie banner and settings dialog**, with the wording editable in the control panel under
  **Globals → Consent**. Every route out of the banner — accept all, essential only, settings — is
  one click and looks like the others.
- **`{{ consent:gate }}`**, a two-click gate that parks the embed in a `<template>`, so no request
  reaches the third party before the visitor allows it.
- **`{{ consent:granted }}`, `{{ consent:settings_link }}`, `{{ consent:head }}`,
  `{{ consent:banner }}`** — see the README for signatures.
- **Parked scripts** via `<script type="text/plain" data-consent-service="…">`.
- **Global Privacy Control** is honoured: a visitor sending the signal is recorded as having
  rejected, and is not asked again.
- **English and German** translations; a field left empty in the control panel falls back to the
  shipped text in the visitor's language.
- **`php please consent:install`** publishes the assets and blueprint and seeds the global set.
- **Google Consent Mode v2**, off by default. Map each of Google's four signals to the services
  behind it; the `consent default` call is written inline and first, the update follows the
  visitor's decision.
